**Number Guessing Game** 
This repository contains a Python implementation of a number guessing game with two modes: player versus computer and computer versus player.

**Features** 
Player Guessing Mode: The player guesses a number between 1 and a specified upper limit. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high until the correct number is guessed. Computer Guessing Mode: The computer attempts to guess a number chosen by the player. The player provides feedback to the computer whether its guess is too high, too low, or correct. The computer adjusts its guesses based on the feedback.

**Functions** 
guess(x): Allows the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and x. The player receives feedback on each guess until the correct number is guessed.

computer_guess(x): The computer tries to guess a number chosen by the player between 1 and x. The player provides feedback to the computer until it guesses the correct number.
